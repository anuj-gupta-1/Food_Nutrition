Notes:
- nutrition_json will contain all available nutrition fields, e.g., energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugar, fiber, sodium, vitamins, etc.
- All raw scraped data will be backed up as JSON files in the raw_data/ folder.
- This document will be updated as new requirements or fields are identified.

Future Improvements
-------------------
1. Introduce LLMs to ensure completeness of scraped data - completeness score, get missing values, categorisation, duplicate products, standardisation of nutrients, intake based on serving size, etc.
